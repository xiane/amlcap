amlcap - Captures video from a V4L2 device and compresses it to a hevc bitstream
		using the S905x3/S922 hardware codec.

Usage:

	./amlcap [-d v4l2_device_name] [-o output_file_name]
	
	Captures and writes a hevc bitstream.  V4L2_device_name can be any capture
	device that supports YUYV surfaces. The special file_name "-" outputs to
	stdout instead of a file.  This is useful for piping the data to another
	program such a ffmpeg.  If no V4L2 device is specified, the default of
	"/dev/video0" is used.  If no output file is specified, "default.hevc" is
	used.

	The hevc bitstream output does *not* include framerate information.  This
	will need to specified in the container when muxing.

	test_main() illustrates the simplest use of the API taking a single image
	and converting it to a hevc bitstream.  The image must be in NV12 format or NV21 format.
	
	The following command can be used to onvert an image to NV12 format:
		ffmpeg -i maxresdefault.jpg -pix_fmt nv12 maxresdefault.yuv
